## Planning First: How I Finally Finished What I Started in 2025

For a long time, my default workflow for personal projects went like this:  

Get an idea → Open my editor → Start coding.

No outline. No spec. Just… go.

At the time, it felt like momentum. In hindsight, it was just **motion without direction**. I’d spend hours or days writing logic, only to realize I’d drifted far from the original intent. Worse, I often didn’t even *know* what the original intent was anymore. I wasn’t building; I was wandering.

Projects didn’t stall because the code was hard. They stalled because I lost the objective. Midway through, I’d forget what problem I was solving or why a certain piece mattered. Without a clear target, every decision felt arbitrary, and progress became aimless.

## The Shift

Sometime this year, I asked myself: *How do actual teams ship products?*

When a company launches a new product or feature, they start with planning: defining the problem, clarifying the goal, and mapping out what needs to be built before a single line of code is written.

Only then do they write code.

That felt obvious but I’d never applied it to my own work.

So I decided to try it. On my next project, I made a rule: **no coding until there’s a plan**.

## What “Planning First” Actually Looked Like

It wasn’t elaborate. I opened a plain text file and wrote:

- **What problem am I solving?**
- **Who is this for? (Even if it’s just me.)**
- **What does “done” look like for v1?**
- **What data do I need to store?**
- **What are the key components or modules?**

I used an AI assistant not to build the app, but to help organize my scattered thoughts into a coherent outline. Then I reviewed it critically. Did this actually solve the problem? Was anything missing?

This step simple as it sounds made all the difference. When I thought through the data model *before coding*, I could **envision the fields and relationships I’d need**, not just guess while debugging later. I avoided building entire features that didn’t align with the core goal.oal.

## The Result

Yes, I still discovered gaps during implementation. That’s normal. But because I had a clear baseline, those adjustments were minor course corrections, not total derailments.

Most importantly: **I shipped**. Not in months. Not after endless tweaks. But in a focused burst, because I knew exactly what I was building and why.

## One Takeaway

Planning first isn’t about bureaucracy. It’s about **intentionality**. It’s the difference between typing code and building something that matters even if it’s just a small tool for yourself.

In 2025, this small shift helped me stop starting and finally start finishing. Here’s to clearer builds in 2026.
