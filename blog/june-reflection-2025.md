## What is June Reflection 2025?

In this post, we will explore **June Reflection 2025**. This month, the main thing on my mind has been impostor syndrome. Ever since I started my internship at Shopify, it’s been popping up more often — usually triggered by how big everything feels. Sometimes I’ll just be deep in thought and suddenly wonder, “Am I really cut out for this?”

I’ve felt impostor syndrome before, but it’s definitely become more noticeable during the internship. To make sense of it, I talked to some people on my team and asked how they deal with it. Turns out, a lot of them have gone through the same thing. One idea that stuck with me was that impostor syndrome is actually a sign that you're learning and growing — it's proof you're in the uncomfortable zone, which is exactly where growth happens.

I’ve been trying to remind myself of that. The way I see it now, it’s like running a marathon. You might be walking or running, but either way, you’re still heading toward the finish line. Everyone moves at their own pace, and that’s okay. So whenever that impostor feeling creeps in, I try to take a breath and remind myself: you’re moving forward, and you’ll get there. Just keep going. Embrace it.
