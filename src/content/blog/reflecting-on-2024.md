## The 2024 Year in Review

- Published blog posts - 90
- Read books - 23

Time is flying by this year. Since I set up my daily routine a year ago, I've reached a point where I need to adjust it to fit my schedule and goals better. I’ve started using new tools to stay more organized and track everything more effectively. One tool I’ve found particularly helpful is Google Docs, which now has a feature that lets you add document tabs. This has made organizing my daily journal much easier.

With the document tabs, I can set up a journal for the whole month in one file, with each day being a separate tab. This method allows me to plan my tasks by day of the week and add my to-do list for each day. I can quickly see what I need to do, and it helps me stay on top of my tasks. It’s also convenient because all my journals for the month are in one file, making it much easier to stay organized.

Although Google Docs is great for my daily journaling, I still use Notion for keeping track of my blog posts, draft ideas, and creative work. Notion helps me stay organized by allowing me to brainstorm, plan, and keep everything in one place. It’s perfect for organizing my thoughts and ensuring I don’t forget any ideas for future blog posts.

This year, I also decided to go back to school and am now enrolled at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). I felt it was time to further my education and build on my skills. The experience has been rewarding so far. I’ve learned new concepts and technologies that are already helping me in my personal and professional life.

Some of the subjects I’ve studied include Unified Modeling Language (UML), which teaches me how to create diagrams to represent software systems. I’ve also explored data modeling, which helps me understand how data is structured and organized for applications. Additionally, I’ve worked with Python Flask, a web framework that’s helping me build web applications more effectively. Other topics like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Azure have broadened my understanding of software development processes.

Overall, this year has been full of growth and adjustments. I’m excited to continue learning and improving in the coming year.

## The upcoming year

Looking back on 2024, I feel that I’ve only started to explore cloud computing. In 2025, I plan to expand my knowledge of cloud platforms and deployment techniques. Alongside cloud computing, I also aim to improve my skills in DevOps, SQL/database management, and cybersecurity.

For DevOps, I want to focus on automation and continuous integration/deployment to enhance development workflows. In SQL, I hope to improve my ability to write efficient queries, manage large datasets, and optimize database performance.

Cybersecurity is another key area I want to explore. With the growing number of security threats, I’m eager to learn more about how to protect systems and data from potential vulnerabilities.

By working on these goals, I aim to build a strong, well-rounded skill set in cloud computing, DevOps, SQL, and cybersecurity throughout the coming year.
