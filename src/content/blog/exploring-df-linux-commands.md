## What is the df Command in Linux?

The **df** command in Linux is used to display information about disk space usage on file systems. It shows how much space is used, available, and where it's mounted. It's a quick and essential tool for monitoring storage on local drives, external disks, and mounted network volumes.

**Key features include:**
- Shows total, used, and available disk space
- Lists mount points for all file systems
- Supports human-readable format for easy reading
- Can filter output by file system type or specific paths

### Basic Syntax:

```bash
df [OPTIONS] [FILESYSTEM or PATH]
```

### Example:

```bash
df
```

This will display disk usage for all mounted file systems.

| Option        | What It Does                                  | Example                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `-h`          | Human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB)             | `df -h`                                     |
| `-T`          | Show file system type                         | `df -T`                                     |
| `-a`          | Include pseudo and hidden file systems        | `df -a`                                     |
| `-t TYPE`     | Show only file systems of a certain type      | `df -t ext4`                                |
| `-x TYPE`     | Exclude file systems of a certain type        | `df -x tmpfs`                               |

## Common Use Cases

- View disk usage in human-readable format

```bash
df -h
```

- Check disk usage of a specific directory

```bash
df -h /home
```

- Show file system types along with disk usage

```bash
df -T
```

- Exclude temporary file systems like `tmpfs`

```bash
df -h -x tmpfs
```

- Display all file systems including dummy mounts

```bash
df -a
```

- Filter to only show ext4 file systems

```bash
df -t ext4
```
