## 🎒Technical Backpack

This month, I had a thoughtful chat with my manager at Shopify. I asked them a simple question:  

> What’s the one thing you wish you knew before starting a new software project?

Their answer wasn’t about specific tools or languages — it was about understanding the **context**: the purpose of the system, the tradeoffs made along the way, and the people involved. That answer stayed with me. It made me reflect on how I approach learning and growth as a developer.

I started thinking of everything I’ve learned — and unlearned — as part of a **technical backpack**. Over time, we pack this backpack with tools, concepts, habits, and assumptions. But eventually, it gets heavy. Growth isn’t just about adding more — it’s also about knowing when to reorganize, replace, or remove what no longer serves us.

## 🧠 Not Just Skills — Context and Judgment

That conversation reminded me that knowing *how* to write code is only one piece of the puzzle. Just as important is understanding *why* something was built a certain way, *who* it serves, and *what constraints* shaped it. These are the kinds of things you can’t learn from documentation alone.

So this month, I’ve been asking myself: **What’s actually worth carrying in my backpack?**

## 🧰 What I Packed This Month

Here are a few things I consciously added:

- A stronger focus on **clarity over cleverness** — choosing designs that are boring but reliable.
- Building an instinct to **trace problems deeply**, instead of just patching symptoms.
- Getting better at balancing tradeoffs — knowing when to build something custom and when to lean on well-supported tools.
- More respect for things I once overlooked, like meaningful commit messages and documenting tricky edge cases.

These aren’t “new technologies,” but they’re just as important for writing maintainable, collaborative software.

## 🗑️ What I Let Go Of

Just as importantly, I made space by letting go of things that were no longer serving me:

- The urge to overengineer or abstract too early.
- The assumption that I always need to prove myself by doing everything from scratch.
- Old habits that added friction — like relying only on print statements instead of learning better observability tools.

Some of these ideas originated from a beginner's mindset; others were holdovers from past projects. Either way, it felt good to lighten the load.

## 🧭 What This Backpack Really Carries

The technical backpack isn’t just a storage space — it’s a reflection of how we **think**, not just what we know. And every so often, it’s worth opening it up and asking:

- Does this still serve me?
- Is there a simpler way to solve this now?
- Am I carrying this because it’s useful — or just because it’s familiar?

Carrying everything slows you down. The goal isn’t to have the heaviest backpack — it’s to **pack wisely for where you’re headed**.

## 🔭 What’s Next

I want to continue this process — not just learning new things, but reflecting on what’s worth keeping. That includes:

- Reviewing older projects to see if my decisions still hold up.
- Rethinking the tools I default to and exploring better fits for my current goals.
- Being more intentional about what I choose to learn and apply.

Because in tech, you’ll never know everything — and that’s okay. What matters is **how you carry what you know**, and how that helps you continue to grow.

## Thank you!
Big thanks for reading! You’re awesome, and I hope this post helped. Until next time!
