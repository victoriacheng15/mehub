## Monthly Reflection

Time flies, and March is almost over! This month, I decided to move forward in my learning journey by starting a new project called **the Gopher Learning**. Inspired by challenges like *100 Days of Code*, this project is my way of diving deeper into Go (Golang). I’m not sure how long it will last, but for now, I’m enjoying the process and making steady progress. As of today, I’m on **Day 07**!

Here’s what I’ve covered so far:

- **Day 01**: Basic "Hello, World!" function
- **Day 02**: Declaring variables with types using `var`
- **Day 03**: Declaring variables with types using `const`
- **Day 04**: Data Types - Booleans and Integers
- **Day 05**: Data Types - Floating-point numbers with `float32` and `float64`
- **Day 06**: Data Type - Strings
- **Day 07**: Data Type - Byte and Rune

It’s been a fun and rewarding experience so far, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next!

### Exploring Ansible

Over the past month, I also started learning Ansible, and it has been a very interesting experience. As my first automation tool, Ansible is powerful and easy to use for managing servers, whether for a small home lab or larger systems. To practice, I use two Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs) as my testing environment. This setup allows me to try playbooks, simulate working with multiple servers, and learn without worrying about breaking anything important.

So far, I’ve used Ansible to automate simple tasks like installing software, setting up users, and configuring services on my two Ubuntu VMs. Writing playbooks—YAML files that define tasks—has been fun and satisfying. For example, I can update all my servers with one command instead of logging into each one manually. This shows how Ansible can save time, especially when managing many servers.

Even though my setup is small, I can see how Ansible would help people managing dozens or even thousands of servers. Tasks like deploying apps, keeping configurations consistent, and performing regular maintenance become much easier with Ansible. It’s not just about saving time—it also helps reduce mistakes and keeps systems reliable.

As I continue learning Ansible, I’m excited to try more advanced features, like managing inventory files, using roles for reusable setups, and connecting Ansible with other DevOps tools. For now, my two Ubuntu VMs are a great place to experiment and learn. Ansible has shown me how powerful automation can be, and I’m excited to see where this learning journey goes.

## Books I’ve Read

L**ife 3.0: Being Human in the Age of ARtifical Intelligence** by Max Tegmark: 

- Looks at how AI will affect humanity's future. It describes life in three stages: 1.0 (biological, like bacteria), 2.0 (cultural, like humans), and 3.0 (AI that can redesign itself). Tegmark talks about AI's possibilities, such as solving big problems like poverty and disease, but also its risks, like causing societal collapse. He stresses the importance of making sure AI matches human values and that people work together to create a good future. The book shows both positive and negative ways AI could evolve.
