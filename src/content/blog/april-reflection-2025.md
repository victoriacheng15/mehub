## Vibe Coding: A Trend I’m Watching

So, there’s this whole **“vibe coding”** thing popping up—tools like Cursor, Trae, and Firebase Studio letting people spit out code just by describing what they want. As a student still learning the ropes, I’m kinda sitting back with my popcorn, watching how this plays out. Not saying it’s good or bad… just *interesting*.

### From the Sidelines: What I'm Noticing

**For Non-Coders: The Wild West of Developme**

On one hand, it's pretty cool:
- **Lowered Barriers**: Tools that generate code from prompts could enable more people to prototype ideas, potentially increasing indie projects and startups.
- **Quality Concerns**: Without technical oversight, these projects risk poor scalability or security flaws—like AI-generated authentication code with hidden vulnerabilities.

But there's a flip side:
- **Quality Roulette**: That AI-generated login system might work... until it leaks all your data
- **The Expertise Gap**: Without tech-savvy oversight, these projects could become maintenance nightmares

**For Developers: A Changing Job Description**

What fascinates me most is how this shifts our role:

- **Bye-bye, Boilerplate**: AI handles repetitive tasks (e.g., setting up auth or API endpoints), freeing time for architecture and problem-solving .
- **Hello, New Challenges**: Debugging AI-written code requires understanding patterns it might miss (like race conditions).

### Connecting the Dots

This brings me to three big-picture observations:

1. **Critical Thinking Becomes King**
    - We'll spend less time memorizing syntax, more time asking:
        - *"Does this actually make sense?"*
        - *"How might this break in production?"*
2. **The Human-AI Tag Team**
    - Best case scenario? We become:
        - **Architects** designing systems
        - **Editors** polishing AI's first drafts
        - **Ethics Reviewers** catching biased or unsafe code
3. **An Evolving Skillset**
    After watching this trend unfold, I'm focusing on:
    - **Core Fundamentals** (algorithms, system design) - the bedrock beneath the AI magic
    - **AI Whispering** (prompting, output validation) - because garbage in = garbage out
    - **Debugging 2.0** - fixing problems we didn't directly create

*Just my two cents* - I could be totally wrong about where this goes. Tech moves fast, and who knows what next year's tools will look like. But one thing feels certain: developers who can blend old-school skills with smart AI collaboration will ride this wave best.

## Books I’ve Read

Sleep: The Myth of 8 hours

- Challenges the one-size-fits-all sleep rule, detailing how genetics, lifestyle, and sleep cycles affect rest needs. Offers science-backed tips for optimizing sleep quality, productivity, and health without rigid hour counts.

Learning the bash Shell

- A comprehensive guide to Unix/Linux shell scripting, covering fundamentals (commands, file management) to advanced automation. Ideal for sysadmins and programmers to streamline workflows using bash.

I will Teach you how to be rich

- Challenges traditional money advice with a practical 6-week system focusing on automation, smart investing, and conscious spending. Covers credit optimization, salary negotiation, and building long-term wealth through index funds, while encouraging guilt-free spending on personal priorities.

The One Thing

- Challenges multitasking and diluted focus by advocating extreme prioritization of your single most impactful task. Details how "focusing question" (What's the ONE Thing I can do to make everything else easier?) drives extraordinary results in work and life. Offers practical strategies to eliminate distractions, build productivity habits, and achieve mastery through sequential focus.
