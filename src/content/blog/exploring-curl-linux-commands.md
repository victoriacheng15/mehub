## What is the curl Command in Linux?

The **curl** command in Linux is a versatile tool used to transfer data to or from a server, using a variety of protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Unlike wget, which is mainly focused on downloading files, curl is designed to work with data transfers in both directions and is often used for testing APIs, uploading data, or interacting with web services.

**Key features include:**

- Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SCP, SFTP, and more)
- Can send custom HTTP headers and data (useful for APIs)
- Supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Handles authentication (Basic, Digest, OAuth, etc.)
- Supports cookies and session management
- Ability to upload files or data
- Shows detailed request/response headers for debugging
- Works well in scripts and automation pipelines

### Basic Syntax

```bash
curl [OPTIONS] URL
```

### Example

```bash
curl https://example.com
```

This will fetch the content of the webpage and output it to the terminal.

|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `-o FILE`      | Save output to a file                         | `curl -o backup.zip [URL]`                   |
| `-O`           | Save with original filename                   | `curl -O [URL]`                              |
| `-L`           | Follow redirects                              | `curl -L [URL]`                              |
| `-d DATA`      | Send POST data                                | `curl -d "a=1&b=2" -X POST [URL]`            |
| `-H HEADER`    | Add custom header                             | `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json"`   |
| `-X METHOD`    | Set request method                            | `curl -X POST [URL]`                         |
| `-u USER:PASS` | Use basic auth                                | `curl -u user:pass [URL]`                    |
| `-s`           | Silent mode (no output except result)         | `curl -s [URL]`                              |
| `-I`           | Show only headers                             | `curl -I [URL]`                              |

## Common Use Cases

- Download and save a file with a custom name

```bash
curl -o backup.zip https://example.com/file.zip
```

- Download and save with the original remote file name

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
```

- Follow redirects (e.g., from shortened URLs)

```bash
curl -L http://bit.ly/some-short-url
```

- Send POST form data to an API

```bash
curl -d "username=username&password=password" -X POST https://api.example.com/login
```

- Send JSON data with a custom header

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Victoria"}' -X POST https://api.example.com/users
```

- Use basic authentication

```bash
curl -u user:pass https://api.example.com/secure-data
```

- Download a file silently (no progress output)

```bash
curl -s -O https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

- Fetch only HTTP headers (e.g., for debugging)

```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```
