## What are UNION and UNION ALL?

TheÂ `UNION`Â andÂ `UNION ALL`Â operators in SQL are used to combine the results of two or moreÂ `SELECT`Â queries into a single result set. They allow you to merge data from different tables or queries, making them essential for reporting and data analysis.

- **`UNION`**Â combines results and removes duplicate rows.
- **`UNION ALL`**Â combines results but keeps all rows, including duplicates.

Think of them as tools for stacking datasets verticallyâ€”like appending one list to another.

## How Do UNION and UNION ALL Work?

Both operators require that the queries being combined have theÂ **same number of columns**Â andÂ **compatible data types**. The key difference is in how they handle duplicates:

- **`UNION`**Â performs aÂ **distinct operation**, eliminating duplicate rows.
- **`UNION ALL`**Â **does not remove duplicates**, making it faster since it skips the deduplication step.

### Basic Syntax:

```sql
-- Using UNION (removes duplicates)
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

-- Using UNION ALL (keeps duplicates)
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

## Example: Combining Customer Data

Imagine you have two tables:

- `customers_east`Â (stores customers from the East region)
- `customers_west`Â (stores customers from the West region)

You want to create aÂ **single list of all customers**.

### Using UNION (No Duplicates)

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers_east
UNION
SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers_west;
```

**What Happens?** If a customer exists inÂ **both tables**, onlyÂ **one copy**Â appears in the result.

### Using UNION ALL (All Rows, Including Duplicates)

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers_east
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers_west;
```

**What Happens?** If a customer exists in both tables,Â **both copies**Â appear in the result.

## When to Use UNION vs. UNION ALL?

| **Scenario** | **Use** | **Reason** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Need unique records only | `UNION` | Removes duplicates |
| Want all records (faster) | `UNION ALL` | No duplicate check, better performance |
| Combining similar datasets | `UNION ALL` | If duplicates are acceptable or unlikely |

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Column Matching:**Â Queries must have the same number of columns with compatible data types.
2. **Performance:**Â `UNION ALL`Â is faster thanÂ `UNION`Â because it doesnâ€™t remove duplicates.
3. **Ordering:**Â If you need sorted results, addÂ `ORDER BY`Â at theÂ **end of the last query**.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT name FROM contractors
    ORDER BY name;
    ```
    
4. **Use in Complex Queries:**Â You can combineÂ `UNION`Â withÂ `WHERE`,Â `GROUP BY`, and other clauses.

## Recap

- **`UNION`**Â merges results and removes duplicates.
- **`UNION ALL`**Â merges results and keeps duplicates.
- Both require matching columns and data types.
- UseÂ `UNION ALL`Â when duplicates donâ€™t matter for better performance.
