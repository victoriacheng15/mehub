    paragraphs: |
      - I transitioned from Packaging Engineering, designing physical solutions for real-world chaos, to Software Engineering. I trade CAD drawings for CI/CD pipelines and physical constraints for cloud infrastructure.
      - My time at Shopify reinforced a "measure twice, cut once" mindset. I focus on preventing regressions and ensuring systems remain resilient under the load of millions of concurrent users.
      - This site is where architectural logic meets the reality of continuous learning. I document the "why" behind decisions, the trade-offs of every stack, and the curiosity that drives me deeper into the internals.
